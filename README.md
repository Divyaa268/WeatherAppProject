# WeatherNow : A Simple Weather Application ‚õÖ‚òÄÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏èüåß 

WeatherNow: 

WeatherNow is a user-friendly weather application that provides real-time weather information for various locations. This web-based project utilizes the WeatherAPI to fetch and display current weather conditions. The application's interface includes the temperature, city name, date and time, weather condition icon, and a textual description of the weather.

# Features : 

‚òÄÔ∏è Live Weather Data: WeatherNow fetches current weather data from the WeatherAPI in real-time, ensuring that users receive the latest updates.

‚òÄÔ∏è User-Friendly Interface: The application's intuitive interface prominently displays essential weather information, such as temperature and city name, making it easy for users to quickly access relevant data.

‚òÄÔ∏è Dynamic Icons: Weather condition icons provide visual cues about the current weather. These icons change based on the weather condition, enhancing the user experience.

‚òÄÔ∏è Date and Time: Alongside weather details, the application also shows the current date, time, and the day of the week, offering users a comprehensive snapshot of the current conditions.

# How It Works :

By default, the application displays weather information for the city of Lucknow.
Users can enter the name of a city in the search bar and hit "Submit" to retrieve weather data for that location.
The application then communicates with the WeatherAPI to fetch the latest weather data for the specified city.
The fetched data includes temperature, weather condition, city name, and more.
The application's interface is dynamically updated to showcase the new weather information, including the updated temperature, city name, weather condition icon, and a description of the weather.
Users can continue to search for weather information in different cities by entering new names in the search bar.

# Behind the Scenes :

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code fetches data from the WeatherAPI using the fetch function and updates the DOM elements with the received data. The application's functionality includes error handling for cases where the entered city is not found.

WeatherNow not only provides users with an easily accessible way to stay informed about weather conditions in different locations but also showcases the power of web technologies in delivering real-time data.
